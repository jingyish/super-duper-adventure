## Field-based PCB Testing – Loop Card & BMS Boards

In the field, I’m often responsible for diagnosing two types of boards used in energy storage systems: loop cards (fire safety system boards) and BMS (battery management system) communication boards.

### 1. Loop Card – Programming & Control Verification

These boards manage components like contactors and fans in fire suppression systems. I check:
- **Programming interface continuity**:  
  Using a multimeter, I verify if UART or SWD pins are properly connected to the microcontroller.  
  If there's an open circuit, the board may fail to accept firmware, triggering errors like “program not loaded.”
- **Control signal paths**:  
  I test relay control lines, 24V input power, and trace continuity from connectors to loads.

### 2. BMS Communication Board 

These boards report battery pack data over CAN bus. My field checks include:
- **CAN-H and CAN-L trace continuity** from connector to CAN transceiver
- **End-to-end bus resistance** 

Although I didn’t design these boards, my experience with hands-on testing has given me strong diagnostic intuition to determine if a board can be reused or should be replaced.
